All numbers on the board will slide into that direction until they hit the wall and if they bump into each other then two numbers will be combined into one if they have the same value. Each number will only be combined once per move. Every move a new number 2 or 4 appears. If you have a 2048 on the board you have won, but you lose once the board is full and you cannot make a move. \r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n- GCC or VS Express 2013 for desktop\r\n- GNU/Linux or Windows\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n####For Windows version\r\n\r\n#####Get files\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ZhengMingpei/2048.c/blob/master/windows/main.c,\r\nhttps://github.com/ZhengMingpei/2048.c/blob/master/windows/draw.h,\r\n\r\n#####Compile by VS Express 2013\r\n\r\nNew Project - VC++ - Blank project, add main.c and draw.h to the project, compile and run it.\r\n\r\n####For Linux version\r\n```\r\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mevdschee/2048.c/master/2048.c\r\ngcc -o 2048 2048.c\r\n./2048\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Running\r\n\r\nThe game supports different color schemes.
